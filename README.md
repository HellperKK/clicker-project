# clicker-project

## objective

This project's objective is to build a web app in react and then build two copies of that app, one made with vuejs and one made with angular. That way I can see the differences between each tool. I chose to make a clicker game as I felt it could be a nice ways to do that exercice.

Obviously I'm not an expert of the three frameworks so feel free to open an issue if you have some suggestions to make!

You can try the game [here](https://hellperkk.github.io/clicker-project/)


## how to use

Each projet folder has a README.md which explains how to run the project.
