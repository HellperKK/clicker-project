# clicker-react

A clicker game made with react.

The main objective of this project is to build a web app in react and then build two copies of that app, one made with vuejs and one made with angular. That way I can see the differences between each tool. I chose to make a clicker game as I felt it could be a nice ways to do that exercice.

Obviously I'm not an expert of the three frameworks so feel free to open an issue if you have some suggestions to make!
