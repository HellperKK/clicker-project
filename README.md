# clicker-project

## objective

This project's objective is to build a web app in react and then build many copies of that app using other frameworks. That way I can see the differences between each framework and hopefuly see their pros and cons. I chose to make a clicker game as I felt it could be a nice ways to do that exercice.

Currently there are 5 clickers being developped:
- typescript/react
- typescript/vuejs
- typescript/angular
- elm/elm-architecture
- typescript/svelte

Obviously I'm not an expert of all those frameworks so feel free to open an issue if you have some suggestions to make!

You can try the game [here](https://hellperkk.github.io/clicker-project/)
